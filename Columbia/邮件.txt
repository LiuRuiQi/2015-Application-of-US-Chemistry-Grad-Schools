Dear Nina,


Chemistry has a policy that does not allow us to release score or grade information.  The scores of our admitted applicants covers a large range.  We have admitted a number of students from Peking University.
 
 If you would like to be considered for Columbia University's Graduate
 Chemistry Department program, you must complete the on-line
 application.  Information and applications may be obtained by visiting
 the following two websites:
 http://gsas.columbia.edu/admissions and http://www.columbia.edu/cu/chemistry/
 We offer a full fellowship package including tuition, health
 insurance, fees, and a living stipend
 (for Fall 2015/Spring 2016 it will be $35,048) and below market rate housing.

The application process will open in September for Fall 2016, and the
 deadline is December 15. If you need more time missing materials may be submitted up until January 2.

The application fee is approximately $105.00.

Best wishes,

Alix Lamia
