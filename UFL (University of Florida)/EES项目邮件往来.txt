EES: Environmental Engineering Science




Nina,

               Great to learn your interest in pursuing your PhD at UF-EES/  We do not provide the average GPA or GRE scores.  The admission for PhD students is mainly selected by the professor whose expertise matches your interest instead of a departmental selection. 

               For privacy reason, I cannot directly disclose student info to you.  However, I can suggest a few ways.  1.  Identify the professor who you may be interested in working with, and ask the professor if any of his/her student will be willing to contact you to allow you to ask questions.   2. Inquire through the Chinese student and scholar association http://uflchina.org/.  3. If your tell me the general area of your interest, I can see if I can find one in that area to communicate with you.  Hope one of these would work for you.

               Cheers!

               C Y Wu

Good morning Prof!

I'm Nina Chen from Beijing, China. I'm writting to try to know a bit more about the EES phD program of UFL.  It's so nice of you to offer me help here cause I think I really need some now :)

 

I'm from Peking University, the best (or let's say top two) university in China, majored in chemistry. Can you please tell me more about the average GRE and gpa of current students?  If you're not allowed to release such info I can also understand, but it will really help a lot if I can know about the average gpa and GRE of students accepted this year.

 

I noticed that there're several Chinese students in calss of 2015, if I can talk to one of them that will be extremely helpful, do you think you can introduce me to one of them?

 

Thanks a lot and have a nice day!
